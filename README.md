# üîç Fake or Real News using NLP

### üìú **Overview**  
The rapid spread of online information has given rise to a significant challenge: the proliferation of fake news. Misinformation and disinformation can have widespread social, political, and economic consequences, making fake news detection a critical issue in today's digital landscape.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) provides powerful solutions for identifying fake news by analyzing textual patterns, linguistic features, and contextual information. Unlike traditional fact-checking methods, NLP-powered models can process vast amounts of news data in real-time, detect subtle manipulations, and classify articles based on authenticity. By leveraging deep learning, transformer-based models (like BERT), and sentiment analysis, NLP enhances the accuracy and efficiency of automated fake news detection systems.

### üöÄ **Project Workflow**

1. **Data Searching and Collection**  
   Gathering data from Kaggle for model training.
   [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gdsc-ml-workshop-final-project/data)

2. **Data Preparation, Cleaning, and Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing or corrupted data.
   - Removing irrelevant features and scaling the data as needed.

3. **Statistical Analysis and Data Visualization**  
   - Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key trends and patterns.

4. **Model Architecture Design**  
   Designing ML models such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradiant boost.

5. **Applying NLP Techniques to Text Datasets**  
   Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to process and analyze unstructured text data and enhance fraud detection. Techniques used include:
   - **SpaCy** for text parsing.
   - **NLTK** for tokenization and sentiment analysis.
